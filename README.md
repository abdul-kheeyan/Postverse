# Postverse 🚀

Postverse is a lightweight, mini social media web app inspired by modern platforms like Instagram — but built from scratch using **Node.js**, **Express.js**, **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Vanilla JavaScript**, with **no database**. It demonstrates how a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) social feed works with a clean UI and server-side logic.
